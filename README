### README ###

This is a simple demo to compile a AVR appllication using the 
LUFA library out of tree.

Currently it runs on a "Olimexino 32U4" board and just echos back
the characters received on a virtual serial port.

### AM2302 Interface ###

Additionally, if you connect a AM2302 temperature and relative humidity
sensor to port D4/ICP1/ADC8 (digital 4 on the "Arduino board") you can...

 * press "+" to trigger a conversion
 * press "?" to read back temperature and relative humidity from the sensor.

Compared to most other code that can be found on the internet, this library
uses the input capture functionality of Timer/Counter1 to read in the bits.
It does not require the MCU to busy-wait until all bits are clocked in.

### Compileing ###

To compile this program, you have to have LUFA-130901 unpacked in
../LUFA-130901, or adjust the Makefile accordingly.

### Flashing ###

Run ./flash.sh to flash the resulting binary using avrdude and a
AVR dragon programmer in ISP mode.
